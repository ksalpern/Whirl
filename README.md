# Whirl
Hey my friends! You can find the design following the link (figma design)[https://www.figma.com/file/zR45yFHEZaTRzxHn3qBtbK/Whirl?node-id=0%3A1] and also can see completed site following (link)[https://ksalpern.github.io/Whirl/index.html].
It's my second website done with scss, I spent 8 hours on it. It has no responsive layout so it's better to see it with 1440px screen.
